# ShopLTE

A fork of ColorLib's AdminLTE, with an eCommerce focus. Integrates with MongoDB and Shopify (with multi-store support) to frequently poll your orders, and update them onto a live dashboard.

# Installation

To install, you'll need 3 things:
- A Shopify store with admin credentials (a guide to setting that up is here: https://shopify.dev/tutorials/authenticate-a-private-app-with-shopify-admin)
- A MongoDB instance
- A web server to run the backend polling

# Additional Features

This project is a hobby project and as such I'm not taking feature requests for the open source platform.

If, however, you're interested in custom additions, feel free to contact me at finn [at] fccardiff.com.
